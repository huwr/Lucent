macOS status bar app to change display brightness. This is a simple app. 

### Not done

- The brightness (in `NSScreen+Brightness`) does work, but it is a weird way of doing it, and I’m unhappy with it. It seems to change back too easily if macOS is set to auto-matically change brightness. It also may not work on certain computers!

- Doesn’t support multiple displays, and has not been tested with multiple displays
